#Local Law 11 of 2012

> ###The council hereby finds and declares that it is in the best interest of New York city that its agencies and departments make their data available online using open standards. Making city data available online using open standards will make the operation of city government more transparent, effective and accountable to the public. It will streamline intra-governmental and inter-governmental communication and interoperability, permit the public to assist in identifying efficient solutions for government, promote innovative strategies for social progress, and create economic opportunities.

--

+ Understand the context
--

+ Summarize fields
--

+ Use graphical representations of the data
--

+ Explore outliers

#You all knew that, right?

---

#Notice also the heating season

---

#What are the problems with the violations data?
--

+ Very few complaints result in violation
--

+ Can't track complaints to violations
--
 _(at least not easily)_
--

+ Not clear from data when housing law is in effect
--
 _(on warmer days, housing law isn't in effect)_
--

+ No locations (latitude, longitude)

#But when you put it all together...
