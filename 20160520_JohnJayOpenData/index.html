#Now let's look at another dataset

#How would we know to filter by these?

#You all knew that, right?

---

#What are the problems with the violations data?
--

+ Very few complaints result in violation
--

+ Can't track complaints to violations
--
 _(at least not easily)_
--

+ Not clear from data when housing law is in effect
--
 _(on warmer days, housing law isn't in effect)_
--

+ No locations (latitude, longitude)

---

#But when you put it all together...

---

#Wrap-up
--

+ Value of open data
--

+ Concerns with open data
--

+ The history of open data in NYC
--

+ Explored an example of open data in NYC

---

#Final Thoughts
--

+ Access to open data allows organizations to identify problems in their communities and advocate for positive changes
--

+ Not all open data is created equal and some datasets can take more time and effort to understand than others
