#What is Design Thinking?

--
+ A repeatable process employing unique and creative techniques ([Source](http://www.fastcompany.com/919258/design-thinking-what))

--
+ A formal method for practical, creative resolution of problems and creation of solutions, with the intent of an improved future result ([Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_thinking))

---

> What we, as design thinkers, have, is this creative confidence that, when given a difficult problem, we have a methodology that enables us to come up with a solution that nobody has before.

##David Kelley, founder of [IDEO](https://www.ideo.com/) ([source](http://www.fastcompany.com/1139331/ideos-david-kelley-design-thinking))

> ###We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.--That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed.

- US Declaration of Indepdence

> ##We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.
